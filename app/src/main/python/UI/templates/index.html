    <h1>Statistical Analysis </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This application allows users to upload experimental data and perform statistical analysis on it.
        You will chose which tests you would like to run and a report will be generated with the 
        results of these tests
    </p>

    <div id="home">
        <h2> Data Upload </h2>
        <p>Please upload your data here.  This should be in a csv file. </p>

        <form id = "upload_form" action = "{{ url_for('upload') }}" method= "POST" enctype= "multipart/form-data">
            <input type="file" name ="experimental_data", accept=".csv"/>
            <br></br>
            <input type="submit" value = "Upload"/>
            <input type="reset"/>
            
        </form>

        <h2> Experimental Design </h2>
        <p> so far this is just text boxes, however this will be changed to look at the file uploaded and change the UI accordingly.  
            This could be in the form of a list of radio buttons corresponding to variables depending on if the file has headings.</p>

        <form name = "variables" id="exp_design_form" action = "{{ url_for('create_report') }}" method = "POST">
            <label for="significance"> Significance Level: p <  </label>
            <input id="significance" name = "significance" type="number" value="0.05" min="0.001" max="1.0" step="0.001">
            <br>
            <label for= "iv"> Independent Variable: <label>
            <input type="text" name="iv"/>
            
            <label for="dv">Dependent Variable: <label>
            <input type="text" name="dv"/>

            <input type="submit" value = "Upload"/>

        </form>
